            <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 25px;">Hey everyone! My name is Luke Mendiola and this is the website I created for this assignment. 
                I currently live in Romeoville, IL and go to school at Lewis University. 
                My family immigrated from the Philippines to the U.S in 2004, when I was about 2 years old.
                I am currrently majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Math.
                I changed my major 2 times previously, but I plan on sticking to Computer Science as it is something I find to be very interesting.
                        
            </p>
                        <br>

        <h4 style="text-align: center;font-size: 50px;"><b>My Favorite Hobby</b></h4>
            <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 25px;"> Well, I have a lot of different hobbies that I like equally as much, so I'll just name all of them. 
                I enjoy playing video games, riding my motorcycle, listening and creating music, and recently, working out. 
                If I were to pick a favorite, it would be working out. I was always on and off when it came to going to the gym, 
                but after a year of not being in a good state of mind and with the encouragement of my friends, I decided to commit to being healthier, 
                both physically and mentally. I go to the gym about 6 times a week. The combination of feeling pumped and having goals in the gym make me a happier person.
                The best part of it all is the caffeine addiction. :)

                I use to be able to fluently speak my native language (Tagalog) but I completely forgot when I was in 5th grade.</p>
